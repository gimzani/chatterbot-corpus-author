# Chatterbot Corpus Author

Just a tool I whipped up to make authoring bot-yml files.

It's meant to run locally, load files from a folder and download them to your downloads folder.  

This is not a product - it's just a toy, a tool, an idea.

Feel free to use it freely.

## Tech Involved
* Vue 3
* Sass

## To Use

First install packages:
```
npm i
```

Then run it in dev mode with:
```
npm run dev
```

Build it into a dist folder with 
```
npm run build
```

You can preview the build folder with 
```
npm run preview
```
